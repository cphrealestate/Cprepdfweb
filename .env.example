# Sanity CMS Configuration
# Get these values from https://sanity.io/manage

# ===== FOR FRONTEND (React App) =====
# Your Sanity Project ID (for frontend data fetching)
VITE_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_sanity_project_id_here

# Sanity Dataset (usually 'production')
VITE_SANITY_DATASET=production

# ===== FOR SANITY STUDIO (CMS Admin Panel) =====
# Same Project ID (used by Sanity Studio)
SANITY_STUDIO_PROJECT_ID=your_sanity_project_id_here

# Same Dataset (used by Sanity Studio)
SANITY_STUDIO_DATASET=production

# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to .env.local
# 2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Sanity credentials
# 3. Use the SAME project ID for both VITE_ and SANITY_STUDIO_ variables
# 4. NEVER commit .env.local to git (it's already in .gitignore)
# 5. After creating .env.local, restart your dev server
